given width: 500 mm
given height: 300 mm

The stimuli image has 2560 x 1600 pixel. The ration of mm per pixel is asked. This can be calculated by dividing the
number of pixel through the given mm.

width: 500 mm / 2560 px ~ 0.195
height: 300 mm / 1600 px ~ 0.185

The ratio of width and height is quite similar and approximately 0.19. The pixels are quadratic. So 0.19 mm can be used
for one pixel in both directions.

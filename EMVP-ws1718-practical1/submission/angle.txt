Assuming that the participant is looking on the screen with an right angle. The given 1000 px can be converted to 195 mm
by using the previous exercise. So 500 px are 97,5 mm.
Using Pythagoras the hypotenuse can be calculated by the following formular: hypot = sqrt(97,5^2 + 600^2)
To calculate the gaze angle the cos can be used: angle = cos(600/hypot)
This angle needs to be taken twice (angle * 2) to gain the whole angle of the gaze.

After calculating the result, we get an angle of 63,16Â°
